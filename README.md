# SparseSTFT
Sparse Short Time Fourier Transform (SparseSTFT)

The algorithm is based on the constant window function and optimization in the time-domain with two examples.

# Example 
The figure shows the result of **Demo2.py** code.<br />
The top subplot shows the ground motion recorded by Kik-Net stations at Japan. <br />
The middle subplot is the **TF Representation** of seismogram.<br />
The bottom subplot is the reisudal between observed and reconstructed data.<br />
